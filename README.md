# staxter-test-task

This is a service, which exposes two endpoints: an endpoint for user registration and endpoint for user login.
It stores the users in memory, and with every launch of an application the list of users is cleared.

## /userservice/register

An endpoint for user registration. Registers a new user and returns the data about created
user. Consumes JSON body in the following format:

`{`
<br> `"firstName": "Some first name",` </br>
<br> `"lastName": "The last name",` </br>
<br>`"userName": "The user name",` </br>
<br> `"password": "The password in plain text"` </br>
<br> `}` </br>

If the user has been created successfully, returns the response in the following format:

`{`
<br> `"id": "Id generated by the back-end",`
<br> `"firstName": "Some first name",`
<br> `"lastName": "The last name",`
<br> `"userName": "The user name"`
<br> `}`

If the user does exist already, returns the response in the following format:

 `{`
<br> `"code": "USER_ALREADY_EXISTS",`
<br> `"description": "A user with the given username already exists"`
<br> `}`

## /userservice/login

Logs the user in.
Consumes the JSON in the following format:

`{`
<br> `"username": "Username",`
<br> `"password": "Password"`
<br> `}`

If the credentials were recognized and user has logged in successfully, returns

`{`
<br> `"code": "USER_LOGGED_IN_SUCCESSFULLY",`
<br> `"description": "User has received an authorization token and logged in successfully"`
<br> `}`
  
If the credentials were not recognized, returns

`{`
   <br> `"code":"BAD_CREDENTIALS",`
   <br> `"description": "Please, check the credentials. Login or password could be wrong"`
    <br> `}`
